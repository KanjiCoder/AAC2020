            TERMS & DETAILS )

    ************************************************************
    TERMS & DETAILS:
    ************************************************************
        
        ONE_FOURTH_OUNCE_OF_INSTANT_COFFEE :

            The cost of 1/4th ounce of instant coffee
            BEFORE tax, shipping, and handling.

            This can be calculated by taking the cost of
            any commonly available consumer product and
            dividing to get the cost per ounce. And then
            dividing that amount by 4.

            This price is NOT allowed to be calculated using
            bulk factory prices. If you found the price
            on AMAZON.COM , Walmart, Mejier, or another
            online retailer, that price is suitable.
            If you found that price in an actual grocery
            store or coffee shop, that price is also
            suitable.

            This price CANNOT be below 10 cents.
            So if coffee somehow becomes as cheap as water,
            just give us 10 cents per copy of your game sold.

        ENGINE_SPLASH_SCREEN :

            The engine splash screen is a screen that pops
            up with engine information when the engine boots
            up. If you are using an OLD version of the engine,
            this may __NOT__ exist yet.

            That is __OK__. Just don't remove this splash
            screen or otherwise prevent it from popping up
            if it is coded into the engine source.
    
            Also, the splash screen should cover at least
            50% of the surface area of the screen when
            it pops up. The font should be clearly readable
            by someone with 20/20 vision from 30 feet
            away. 
            
            In general, you shouldn't have to worry about 
            any of these details, as the splash screen
            is hard coded into the engine to pop up
            without you having configured it.

        THIRTY_TWO_OUNCES_OF_INSTANT_COFFEE :

            This is the cost in currency of 32 ounces of
            instant coffee. Calculate this value by going 
            to a grocery store, coffee shop, or online
            retailer, and finding a fairly priced product
            and figuring out how much that product would
            cost if you bought exactly 32 ounces of it.

            An unfairly priced product would be something
            from a "going out of business sale" or a bulk
            quantity ordered from a factory. Costco is a grey
            area. I'd prefer you NOT do that. But if you want
            to be a cut throat business asshole kinda guy,
            you can use the price you would find in a
            CostCo or SamsClub store.
        
            Do not factor shipping, handling, or tax into
            the calculation.

            The price MUST be at least 40 cents per ounce.

            If coffee somehow becomes dirt cheap, then you
            must sell your game for at least 16 US dollars.

        COFFEE_LICENSE_PHOTO :

            A Screenshot of the online listing for the
            coffee you are basing your currency values on.

            Or alternatively, a photo of the product on
            a grocery store shelve showing the price and
            number of ounces.

            Or alternatively, a photo of the menu at a 
            coffee shop or what not.
    
            Or alternatively, a receipt from a coffee shop
            or grocery store.

            The purpose of this photo is to calculate how
            much you owe in license royalties and also
            calculate the LOWEST price you are allowed to
            sell your game for.

    Questions And Answer:
    ************************************************************
    #_WHY_DICTATE_HOW_MUCH_I_SELL_MY_GAME_FOR_# :

        We dictate a minimum price you can sell your game
        for in order to discourage shovel ware. Games that
        did not have a lot of thought put into them 
        reflect poorly on our engine. If you use our engine,
        we would like you to put in a quality effort into
        any game you release using our engine.

        I get that this is a bit authoritarian ,
        but we need to look out for our reputation.
