    The WHY:
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    I figured out a solution using a bit of bash. The reason
    I am asking for such a feature is because I want to make
    sure my project can compile using[ gcc -c AAC2020.C11 ]
    no matter how complex my bash-based build system gets.

    I want a low barrier to entry for the code base.
    The bash script is necessary for DEVELOPING/CHANGING
    the code base. But shouldn't be necessary for others who
    just want to include[ AAC2020.C11 ]in their own projects.
    ------------------------------------------------------------


    The WHAT:
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Compiling[ MAIN_PROJECT_FOLDER ]'s C11 file on
    command line will result in[ EXTENSION_CODE_PROJECT ]'s
    C11 file being included.

    
        PARENT_FOLDER[-]
                      |
                      |
                     [-]MAIN_PROJECT_FOLDER
                      |
                     [-]EXTENSION_CODE_PROJECT

    ------------------------------------------------------------

    Main project's C11 file tried to include say...
    "../EXTENSION_CODE_PROJECT/MAIN.C11" but it doesn't
    exist. Rather than throwing compile time error because
    file does not exist, the compilation just ignores this
    and moves on. (Is there a way to do this without making )
    ( my compiler settings less restrictive? )

                      |
                      |
                     [-]MAIN_PROJECT_FOLDER
