    1. Create the base folder.
    2. Create all the sub folders needed.
    3. Use the extension list to copy-paste code into
       these folders.
    4. Use extension list to check off which code we copy-pasted.
    5. Use extension list to build our INCLUDE._ file
    6. Copy from the local AUTOGEN folder to the AAC2020
       engine AUTOGEN folder

    SIX: Extension Code System # 1
       We are done when we can configure
       A: AAC2020_EXTCODE_SHATTER
       B: AAC2020_EXTCODE_MANDELA
       Using: AAC2020_EXT_ORD/EXT_ORD.TXT

        SIX.1. Build INCLUDE._ macros by just putting:
            [ AAC2020_INCLUDE_EXTCODE_ ]+[ PAINT5D ]+[ _FUNC_NAME ]
            Together.
        
        SIX.1.. Save all files to temp AUTOGEN folder
            SIX.2.1 : Copies of things we want to move.
            SIX.2.2 : Generated INCLUDE._ macro file.
            SIX.2.3 : BACKUP of original INCLUDE._ file in the
                  end goal destination AAC2020/LIB/AUTOGEN folder.

        SIX.1.. Copy over to project   AUTOGEN folder once
           complete. But abort on failiure.
    
    7: DonHo face gif export.
       Load DonHo into paint5D and create an animated
       gif. Because we compile our code as 
       both[ C99 ]AND[ GLSL ]we can do software rendering
       of shader code.

       How would you do it otherwise?
    
    8: Make NO_UI startup of AAC2020.exe .
       Where it can batch process images and create
       cool gifs of everything that is in the folder with it.

    9: Cluster Mapping For Canvas User View 
       to let us get tile local interal coordinates.
       ( tilop_x , tilop_y ( tiloper ) )

        6.01 :     AAC2020_P5D1OGL_CludMap_ZOF_1_D
               aac2020_P5D1OGL_UTC_CludMap_ZOF_1_D
        6.02 : AAC2020_P5D1OGL_CludMap_RNG_1_D
        6.03 : AAC2020_P5D1OGL_CludMap_fic_vp0_vp1_clu
        6.04 : AAC2020_P5D1OGL_fic_MAP_tilop

   10:

        PANNING CONTROL:

        NON-primary click to [ DRAG/PAN] the canvas.
        ( non-primary click == RIGHT CLICK )

        DATA NEEDED TO COMPLETE TASK:
        1: Viewport dimensions at time of mouse down.
        2: Mouse down position at time of mouse down.
 

    11:

        Implement[ p5d_a_s ](Snap to viewport extent)
