    TODO_2021_05_07:
        PHEXDUM & FILEBOI 
        Likely both have bugs with asserting a null terminator
        when loading a file. That assertion should only 
        exist if loading a text file. Otherwise we are
        looking at an out of bounds memory address.
        It doesn't segfault because it is just a read,but
        will yeild to unpredictable assertion failures.

    TODO_2021_05_07:

        1. Create a "clear canvas" button so you have something
           you can easily draw on.

        2. Stop using[ U32 ]for RGBA. It lacks bit depth and
           we are getting artifacting. I know you want to be
           efficient, but not at the cost of crappy
           visual quality.

    TODO_2021_05_06: 
        Create mirrored drawer application.
        NEED:
            EDIOVER <-- EDItor Input OVERrides
            1234567
            When certain ones are set, PAINT5D differs it's
            inputs to the overriding system. The overriding
            system can decide to not do anything and give
            control BACK to PAINT5D default input handlers.

            PMIRROR <-- PAINT5D Mirroring brush overriding
                        system. Added AFTER PAINT5D

    TODO_2021_05_06:
        Make "material functions" that can be extended.
        The rendercore functions can call upon the material
        functions to grab different procedurally generated
        tile patterns. The material functions are designed
        WITHOUT auto tiling in mind.

        Material functions are designed in a way where we can
        just CUT+PASTE from shadertoy most of the time and
        the code will just work.

        Make an extension system for this that works like
        [RENCORE]system but does some token replacement of
        shader code being copied over to assure it is 
        compatible with our system.

    TODO_2021_05_05:
        Make: aac2020_rencore_CopyPaste_StringWrap
        Use a utility to make each line exactly 64 characters
        (if possible).
        So... If first character on line is " " we can override
        that character with double quote character.
        And if blank space in character slots
        61,62,63 can replace with (" " + "\n" + space).
        If we would overwrite important data, then line will
        have to go past column limit.

    TODO: Should be able to cut+paste shader code from 
          shadertoy into my engine and have it work without
          any editing.

    TODO_TODAY:
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    1. Create the base folder.
    2. Create all the sub folders needed.
    3. Use the extension list to copy-paste code into
       these folders.
    4. Use extension list to check off which code we copy-pasted.
    5. Use extension list to build our INCLUDE._ file
    6. Copy from the local AUTOGEN folder to the AAC2020
       engine AUTOGEN folder

    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    SIX: Extension Code System # 1
       We are done when we can configure
       A: AAC2020_EXTCODE_SHATTER
       B: AAC2020_EXTCODE_MANDELA
       Using: AAC2020_EXT_ORD/EXT_ORD.TXT

        SIX.1. Build INCLUDE._ macros by just putting:
            [ AAC2020_INCLUDE_EXTCODE_ ]+[ PAINT5D ]+[ _FUNC_NAME ]
            Together.
        
        SIX.1.. Save all files to temp AUTOGEN folder
            SIX.2.1 : Copies of things we want to move.
            SIX.2.2 : Generated INCLUDE._ macro file.
            SIX.2.3 : BACKUP of original INCLUDE._ file in the
                  end goal destination AAC2020/LIB/AUTOGEN folder.

        SIX.1.. Copy over to project   AUTOGEN folder once
           complete. But abort on failiure.
    
    7: DonHo face gif export.
       Load DonHo into paint5D and create an animated
       gif. Because we compile our code as 
       both[ C99 ]AND[ GLSL ]we can do software rendering
       of shader code.

       How would you do it otherwise?
    
    8: Make NO_UI startup of AAC2020.exe .
       Where it can batch process images and create
       cool gifs of everything that is in the folder with it.

    9: Cluster Mapping For Canvas User View 
       to let us get tile local interal coordinates.
       ( tilop_x , tilop_y ( tiloper ) )

   10:

        PANNING CONTROL:

        NON-primary click to [ DRAG/PAN] the canvas.
        ( non-primary click == RIGHT CLICK )

        DATA NEEDED TO COMPLETE TASK:
        1: Viewport dimensions at time of mouse down.
        2: Mouse down position at time of mouse down.
