//:This was NOT named GRADATA (graphics data)
//:          because from past experience I know that 
//:          some of the data on the GPU will be used for
//:          rendering while other data on the GPU may be
//:          used for things like storing the current 
//:          position of enemies.
//:
//:          GPUDATA will keep a local CPU cache of the
//:          arrays of data it pushes to the GPU. Being
//:          careful to always keep both sets of data
//:          in sync (the same).
//:
//:          The reason for this is that querying GPU values
//:          for CPU tasks will use up on bandwidth AND be
//:          relatively slow.
