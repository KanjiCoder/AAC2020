    5:
        POLISH MOUSE WHEEL ZOOM

        Make inverse exponential zoom because the zoom we
        currently have is... PAINFUL to work with. We need
        QUICK EDITING friendly zoom controls.

        UPDATE: Library used to accomplish this is called:
                EDITCAM.D._  &  EDITCAM.F._

    6:

        Implement[ p5d_a_s ](Snap to viewport extent)

    7:

        PANNING CONTROL:

        NON-primary click to [ DRAG/PAN] the canvas.
        ( non-primary click == RIGHT CLICK )

    8:
        ToggleTile should actually... Toggle a tile.
        Right now it never UNSETS a tile after it has
        been set. What the hell is wrong?
