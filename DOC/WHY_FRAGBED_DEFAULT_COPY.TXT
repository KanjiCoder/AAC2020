WHY_FRAGBED_DEFAULT_COPY:

    We copy all of the default shaders hard coded
    into the .EXE's memory (.text segment) so that
    all of our shader pointers are FREEABLE pointers.

    This [consistency/regularity/normalization] makes
    the code simpler. But it also means a bigger memory
    footprint.
