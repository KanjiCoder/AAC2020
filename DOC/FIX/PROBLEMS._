    //:PROBLEMS:

    1. Changing shaders probably deletes my texture allocations.
       (not sure about this)


    3. You need to read this:
        https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Common_Mistakes#glGenTextures_in_render_function

        You are definitely causing a memory leak
        with your call to glGenTextures...

        Possibly texture is not even correctly setup.
