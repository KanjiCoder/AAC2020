
    WHY_COG_IN_DIAGRAM:

    COG.H is in our diagram because previous experience
    has told me that setting up OpenCL <==> OpenGL 
    interop is NOT a trivial task.

    If we decide to add OpenCL or Vulkan to the project,
    the COG.H library will be stubbed into this position.

    However, Since it might also be doing OpenGL <==> Vulkan
    or Vulkan <==> OpenCL interop, we need a different name.

    Maybe: GINTLAY (Graphics_INTerop_LAYer)
