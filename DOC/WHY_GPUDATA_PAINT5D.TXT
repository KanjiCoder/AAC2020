        in our project will be:
    
            VAR:   AAC2020_GPUDATA_PAINT5D_dat
            FILE:  AAC2020_GPUDATA_PAINT5D.D._

        The end goal is a GAME. However, whenever possible,
        compiling up to a non-terminal point in our
        LIBCHAN (library_chain) should yeild a usable product.

        Therefore, when we compile up to:
