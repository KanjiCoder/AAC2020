
//: QUADZOM.D._ : Quadrant Zoomer

//: Nice To Have:
//: An editor mode where we can select different quadrants
//: of the loaded level and zoom into exactly that quadrant.
//:
//: Once zoomed into that quadrant we can then do it all
//: over again picking another quad to zoom into.
//:
//: Until we get deeper and deeper zoomed.
//:
//:                0   1   2   3  <<< Nesting Depth
//: For instace: [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 ] << @STACK_ADDRESS@
//: Would be a zoom of 4 orders of magnitude.
//: First zooming into top left quadrant #0
//: From there zooming into top right quadrant ( #1 )
//: From there zooming into quad #0
//: From there zooming into quad #1
//:
//:

//: Game idea: Find the microscopic atomic bomb hidden
//: somewhere in the level.
