
//:TODOMAN: Todo Manger.
//:         Made into it's own class so that we can
//:         silence todo messages from filling up console
//:         if we want to.
//:
//:         State of AAC2020_SILENCE.TODOMAN 
//:         does NOT affect if we crash on todo calls.
//:
//:         AAC2020_CRASH_ON_VITAL_TODO
//:         AAC2020_CRASH_ON_MAYBE_TODO
//:
//:         Will still manage that.
