    KEYBIND is a DATA ONLY namespace.
    No functions here.

    What about a InitNone() ? function though? 
    That would be okay.

    Maybe this should have been called something like

    "KEYASSOC" for "keyboard associations" instead of
    "KEYBIND" for keyboard bindings? Am I splitting 
    hairs here?
