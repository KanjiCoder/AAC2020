
    FILES IN THIS FOLDER ARE IGNORED BY GIT.
    This is where extension code is copied to when
    building the project.
    
    When our code base detects an extension
    ( folder in format: AAC2020_EXTCODE_1234567 )
    ( folder in format: AAC2020_EXTCODE_******* )
    (          EXAMPLE: AAC2020_EXTCODE_MANDELA )

    The extension code in that project folder is
    copied over to this folder.

        //:These comments were originally in
        //:"INCLUDE._" but because it is copied over into
        //:"INCLUDE.C99" I decided to remove the comments
        //:and put them here.

        //:If using build system script (AAC2020.SH)
        //:this file will be overwritten temporarily
        //:by an auto-generated file. The project will
        //:be built, and then this file will be re-written
        //:to the file system.

        //:Why this way? 

        //:So we can have the project compile out of the box
        //:without the use of the build system if needed.
        //:(DONT WANT AN IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPILE PROJECT!)
        //:(Should compile by just using GCC on AAC2020.C11)
        //:(without anything else!                         )

        //:Default extension list is blank.
        //:Except for this dummy example entry
        //:Include guard used so that this file
        //:is only used if an override is not used...
