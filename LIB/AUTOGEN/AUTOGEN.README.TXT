
    FILES IN THIS FOLDER ARE IGNORED BY GIT.
    This is where extension code is copied to when
    building the project.
    
    When our code base detects an extension
    ( folder in format: AAC2020_EXTCODE_1234567 )
    ( folder in format: AAC2020_EXTCODE_******* )
    (          EXAMPLE: AAC2020_EXTCODE_MANDELA )

    The extension code in that project folder is
    copied over to this folder.
